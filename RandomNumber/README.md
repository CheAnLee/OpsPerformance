# Random Integer in C Language

## Description
In C language, the integer range is between -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 since using 4 bytes keeping it. However, the rand.lib provides numbers from 0 to RAND_MAX which is not matched with the signed int. To align the range and also make sure the random number is discreted in the available range, we do this exam.

## Result
The red line is connected by the dots which indicated to a random number. And having a blue line for the average of all the random numbers. To achieve the gold by getting a straight red line and a blue line to zere.
